	  Support for OMAP's remote processors (dual Cortex-M3/M4
	  and DSP) via the remote processor framework.

	  Currently supported on OMAP4, OMAP5 & DRA7XX SoCs.

	  It gets selected by DSP(2) or IPU(1) OMAP_REMOTEPROC instances,
	  in order to enable multimedia use-cases to run on your platform
	  (multimedia codecs are offloaded to remote DSP processors or
	  remoteproc processors controlling other h/w accelerator devices
	  using this framework).

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_IPU
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support for IPU"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTEPROC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable OMAP's IPU remote processor.

	  This option controls only the dual Cortex-M3/M4 processor sub-system.
	  You would want to say y here usually, as this is the sub-system where
	  typically video & imaging codec control s/w is offloaded.

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading (by IPU) or just want a bare minimum kernel.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_LATE_ATTACH_IPU2
	bool "Attach to already-running IPU2 (DRA7xx only)"
	depends on SOC_DRA7XX && OMAP_REMOTEPROC_IPU
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want remoteproc to attach to the IPU2 dual
	  Cortex-M4 processor subsystem on DRA7xx that has already been
	  pre-loaded and started by an external entity prior to kernel boot.

	  Remoteproc will normally load the executable into its memory,
	  program any associated IOMMUs, and release the processor reset.
	  When this option is selected, remoteproc will perform all of its
	  duties except those mentioned. IPC with the remote processor won't
	  be enabled until remoteproc has been invoked, but the remote
	  processors can be performing other activities until that time.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_DSP
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support for DSP"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTEPROC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable OMAP's DSP remote processor.

	  This option controls only the DSP processor sub-system. DSP would
	  typically be used to offload audio codecs or other advanced
	  processing algorithms.

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in offloading
	  audio or any other algorithm (by DSP) or just want a bare minimum kernel.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_IPU1
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support for IPU1 (DRA7xx only)"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTEPROC && SOC_DRA7XX
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable DRA7xx's IPU1 remote processor.

	  This option controls only the first dual-M4 processor sub-system in
	  DRA7xx. You would want to say y here usually, as this is the sub
	  system where some real-time automative stack s/w is offloaded.

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in enabling IPU1
	  or just want a bare minimum kernel.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_LATE_ATTACH_IPU1
	bool "Attach to already-running IPU1 (DRA7xx only)"
	depends on SOC_DRA7XX && OMAP_REMOTEPROC_IPU1
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want remoteproc to attach to the IPU1 dual
	  Cortex-M4 processor subsystem on DRA7xx that has already been
	  pre-loaded and started by an external entity prior to kernel boot.

	  Remoteproc will normally load the executable into its memory,
	  program any associated IOMMUs, and release the processor reset.
	  When this option is selected, remoteproc will perform all of its
	  duties except those mentioned. IPC with the remote processor won't
	  be enabled until remoteproc has been invoked, but the remote
	  processors can be performing other activities until that time.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_DSP2
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support for DSP2 (DRA7xx only)"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTEPROC && SOC_DRA7XX
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable DRA7xx's DSP2 remote processor.

	  This option controls only the DSP2 processor sub-system in DRA7xx.
	  DSP would typically be used to offload audio codecs or other advanced
	  processing algorithms.

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in offloading
	  audio or any other algorithm (by DSP) or just want a bare minimum
	  kernel.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_WATCHDOG
	bool "OMAP remoteproc watchdog timer"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTEPROC_IPU || OMAP_REMOTEPROC_DSP || OMAP_REMOTEPROC_IPU1 || OMAP_REMOTEPROC_DSP2
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable watchdog timer for remote processors.

	  This option controls the watchdog functionality for the remote
	  processors in OMAP. Dedicated timers are used by the remote
	  processors and triggers the timer interrupt upon a watchdog
	  detection.

config STE_MODEM_RPROC
	tristate "STE-Modem remoteproc support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	select REMOTEPROC
	default n
	help
	  Say y or m here to support STE-Modem shared memory driver.
	  This can be either built-in or a loadable module.
	  If unsure say N.

config DA8XX_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remoteproc support"
	depends on ARCH_DAVINCI_DA8XX
	select CMA
	select REMOTEPROC
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to support DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remote processors via the
	  remote processor framework.

	  You want to say y here in order to enable AMP
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  This module controls the name of the firmware file that gets
	  loaded on the DSP.  This file must reside in the /lib/firmware
	  directory.  It can be specified via the module parameter
	  da8xx_fw_name=<filename>, and if not specified will default to
	  "rproc-dsp-fw".

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading.
