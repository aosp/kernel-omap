SoC Audio support for Bluetooth SCO cards based on the Texas Instruments
McASP controller

Required properties:
- compatible : should contain one of:
    * "ti,dra7xx-wl8-bt" for DRA7 EVM boards with WiLink connectivity
- ti,model : The user-visible name of this sound complex
- ti,mcasp-controller : The phandle of the McASP controller

Optional properties:
- ti,bclk-rate : The rate of the bit clock (when supplied externally by the
  connectivity chip)

Example:
bt_sco_sound {
	     compatible = "ti,dra7xx-wl8-bt";
	     ti,model = "DRA7xx-WiLink";
	     ti,mcasp-controller = <&mcasp7>;
	     ti,bclk-rate = <512000>;
};
