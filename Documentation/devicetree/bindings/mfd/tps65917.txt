* TPS65917 device tree bindings

The TI TPS65917 family of PMICs.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be from the list
  ti,tps65917
- interrupt-controller : TPS65917 has its own internal IRQs
- #interrupt-cells : should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags
  The first cell is the IRQ number.
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupts.txt
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Optional properties:
  ti,mux-padX : set the pad register X (1-2) to the correct muxing for the
		hardware, if not set will use muxing in OTP.

Example:

tps65917 {
	compatible = "ti,tps65917";
	reg = <0x58>
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	pmic {
		compatible = "ti,tps65917-pmic";
		....
	};
}
