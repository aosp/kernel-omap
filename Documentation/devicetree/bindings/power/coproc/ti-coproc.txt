Texas Instruments co-processor driver

A co-processor device is a non-cpu processor found on an SoC.

This document describes the clock and voltage configuration
used by co-processors/devices typically found on Texas Instrument SoCs.

Required properties
- compatible: should be
	"ti,coproc"
- clocks: <functional clock>, <dpll clock>
	dpll clock is optional
- clock-names: "fclk", "dpll"
	if you change names here, go chnage the driver too
- clock-target-frequency: Mention your target frequency here
- operating-points: all OPPs applicable for this device/coprocessor
- coproc-voltdm: phandle of the Voltage domain associated with this device/coproc
- voltage-tolerance: Specify a voltage tolerance allowed for this voltage domain
as per datamanual limits

Example:
iva_coproc {
	compatible = "ti,coproc";
	clocks = <&dpll_iva_m2_ck>, <&dpll_iva_ck>;
	clock-names = "fclk", "dpll";
	clock-target-frequency = <532000000>;
	operating-points = <
		388200  1055000
		430000	1150000
		532000  1250000
		>;
	coproc-voltdm = <&voltdm_ivahd>;
	voltage-tolerance = <1>;
};
